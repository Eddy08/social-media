# New Idea for Social-Media

## UI can be coded and modified with a github repo
- Users can add the github repo and that can be seen and shared with other users (ability to share the configurations with other users)

## Comments as the Post for discussion
- Can become posts and can be shared and discussed within the community.

## Ability to Add shareable scroll feeds of music and videos and posts to community or share with other.

## Posts will be of the same theme/ filter and will suggest users for the New Posts automatically that they are clicking with AI generated same feeds

## All the posts will not be copyrighted.

## Redirection from tradational platforms to this platform 
  - Ability to redirect sources like when you are suggesting something that is from the book, navigate to the website and open up the book so that the user can see it.
  - Ability to monetize that book and pay for further use.
